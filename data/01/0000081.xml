        <p>LEAD: Pope John Paul II has named Bishop Norman F. McFarland of Nevada as the new Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange.</p>
        <p>Pope John Paul II has named Bishop Norman F. McFarland of Nevada as the new Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange.</p>
        <p>Bishop McFarland, 64 years old, who has headed the Reno-Las Vegas Diocese for 10 years, succeeds Bishop William R. Johnson, who died July 28. He was the first Bishop of Orange, the second-largest diocese in California, serving 500,000 Catholics.</p>
        <p>The Pope also named three Auxiliary Bishops for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on Monday. They are the Rev. Patrick Ziemann, 45, of Los Angeles; the Rev. Armando Ochoa, 43, of Los Angeles, and the Rev. P. Carl Fisher, 41, of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Father Fisher's appointment makes him the first black Bishop in the Western United States. Archbishop Roger Mahony said he had asked the Pope to appoint a black Auxiliary Bishop ''because Los Angeles has the third-highest overall black population among all the dioceses and archdioceses of the United States.''</p>
        <p>The archdiocese estimates that a million blacks live in its boundaries, about 50,000 of them Catholic.</p>
