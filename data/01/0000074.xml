        <p>LEAD: Venezuela and Egypt have raised their oil prices by up to $1 a barrel and $1.35 a barrel, respectively.</p>
        <p>Venezuela and Egypt have raised their oil prices by up to $1 a barrel and $1.35 a barrel, respectively.</p>
        <p>The newspaper El Universal reported in Caracas that the Venezuelan state oil company had raised its prices for Venezuelan crude exports to $14.50 a barrel and for petroleum products to $16 a barrel. It was the third increase of</p>
        <p>Venezuela's crude oil and fourth for its oil products since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided earlier this month to reduce production and raise prices to an average of $18 a barrel.</p>
        <p>In Egypt, an oil ministry official said that January prices would go up on all grades of its exported oil by $1.35 a barrel. Egypt is not a member of</p>
        <p>OPEC but sets its prices according to the world market.</p>
        <p>The official said the OPEC agreement had improved world market prices, allowing the rise in Egyptian prices. The price of Egypt's top-grade Gulf of Suez blend was increased to $16.60 a barrel.</p>
