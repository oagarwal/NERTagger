        <p>LEAD: The United States will begin the new year with an estimated population of 242.1 million, 15.5 million more people than were counted in the 1980 census.</p>
        <p>The United States will begin the new year with an estimated population of 242.1 million, 15.5 million more people than were counted in the 1980 census.</p>
        <p>The Census Bureau said the new population estimate of 242,085,811 was almost 2.2 million higher than recorded on New Year's Day 1986. Government officials said the country would probably grow by another 2.2 million in 1987.</p>
        <p>While the new figure represents a sizable increase, it is well below the record for net population growth in a single year. In 1956 the population in the United States jumped 3.1 million, to 168 million.</p>
        <p>The current population figure is based on an estimated 3.7 million births, 2.1 million deaths and a net migration of 554,000 in 1986.</p>
        <p>Birth and death levels are expected to be slightly higher in 1987, with the birth figure projected to be at its highest level since the 1960's, the bureau said.</p>
        <p>The population increased nine-tenths of one percent in 1985 and 1986 and 1 percent in each year from 1981 to 1984. In contrast, the annual rate of increase in the peak years of the Baby Boom, from 1947 to 1961, ranged from 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent.</p>
