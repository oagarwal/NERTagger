        <p>LEAD: A Federal judge has overturned a $4.3 million discrimination award to 13 white Chicago police officers who charged they had been transferred from prestigious jobs because of their race and politics.</p>
        <p>A Federal judge has overturned a $4.3 million discrimination award to 13 white Chicago police officers who charged they had been transferred from prestigious jobs because of their race and politics.</p>
        <p>The officers contended in a lawsuit that they had been transferred because they were white and supported Mayor Jane M. Byrne in the 1983 election in which she was defeated by Harold Washington.</p>
        <p>In early September a jury awarded each of the officers $55,000 in compensatory damages and $275,000 in punitive damages, more than the $250,000 sought in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In his ruling Tuesday, Judge Milton I. Shadur said the trial had produced no evidence of political discrimination, although he noted that a reasonable juror might have concluded there was some evidence of racial discrimination.</p>
        <p>Judge Shadur reversed a jury's finding that the 13 were entitled to punitive damages. He also said three of the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensatory damages.</p>
        <p>The judge also ruled that Raleigh Mathis, former executive director of the Office of Municipal Investigations, who along with the city was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, was not personally liable for any damages.</p>
        <p>Judge Shadur reversed the jury's finding of racial discrimination against three of the officers and requested additional information from eight plaintiffs. He gave two officers the option of accepting $15,000 each in compensatory damages or requesting a new trial to determine damages.</p>
