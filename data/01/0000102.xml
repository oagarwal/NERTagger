        <p>Seven people were injured yesterday when fire rose through a fraternity house at Columbia University, sending one group of students onto a third-floor ledge to be rescued with ladders, the Fire Department said.</p>
        <p>Two firefighters and five people who were inside the Iota Epsilon Pi fraternity house were treated at St. Luke's Hospital for smoke inhalation and released, fire officials said. One also was treated for a sprained ankle.</p>
        <p>Among the injured were two girls, 10 and 11 years of age, who were staying with their sister at the co-ed fraternity, according to a Columbia spokesman, Henry Fuhrman.</p>
        <p>The fire broke out in the basement of the four-story brownstone at 534 West 114th Street at 1:07 A.M. Although the cause remains under investigation, a department spokesman said it appeared the blaze began with an electrical short circuit in the basement and spread upward into the building.</p>
