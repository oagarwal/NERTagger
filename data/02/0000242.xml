Up front is a gleaming zinc bar, and the sleek tile dining room has period sconces, Parisian cafe chairs and red banquettes. The essentially American menu is intelligently balanced and the brunch selections include poached eggs with artichoke hearts, country ham and hollandaise sauce; French toast with sauteed apple slices; potato pancakes with sour cream or chunky applesauce, and roast corned beef hash with eggs any style. Entrees $7.75 to $9.50. Fridays, 5:30 P.M. to 1:30 A.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to 1:30 A.M.; Sundays, 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 to 12:30 A.M. GREENE STREET RESTAURANT, #103</p>
        <p>Greene Street (925-2415) - **(April 11, 1986) A dramatic multi-tiered loft in SoHo with sky-high ceiling and a 60-foot mural of vintage New York scenes provides a backdrop for Sunday brunch with musical accompaniment.</p>
        <p>The French-American dishes are precisely tuned and attractively presented, and some of the available options are four different omelets, from shiitake mushroom to crab meat and Gruyere cheese; poached eggs in puffed pastry with asparagus and hollandaise; boneless chicken breast in a Gruyere and truffle sauce, or salad of goat cheese, mache and radicchio. Brunch entrees $9 to $12. Fridays and</p>

LOLA, #30 West 22d Street (675-6700) -*(Dec. 20, 1985) If you want some singing and stomping with your eggs, Marilee Epps gives a gospel concert at 2:30 on Sunday afternoons at Lola. The decor at this Madison Square neighborhood cafe is pastel-colored walls adorned with prints and drawings; the menu features spicy West Indian fare.</p>
        <p>From the all-day brunch offerings you might choose a small plate of West Indian potato and shrimp fritters with chipolte mayonnaise, or Caribbean rum-marinated chicken livers with herbed toast. Large-plate options include shrimp and chicken curry with wild-rice waffles; crab and red snapper cakes with vegetable slaw, and grilled Oriental chicken salad with celery root, carrot remoulade and beets.</p>

MAXWELL'S PLUM, #1181 First Avenue, at 64th Street (628-2100) - **(Dec. 13, 1985) With stained glass galore, carved beams, gas lanterns, stuffed animals and balloons, this high-style cafe is Art Nouveau gone psychedelic. The menu offers a well-honed version of California-style cooking, from light appetizers, pastas and elaborate salads to grilled items of all kinds. The brunch menu includes scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, caviar and sour cream in brioche; pizza with Black Forest ham, goat cheese and sweet red peppers; veal piccata with sauteed spinach, and sauteed shrimp and bay scallops with risotto and tomato-basil sauce. A la carte $7.85 to $23.50. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 1:30 A.M.; Sundays, 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.; 5 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. METROPOLIS, #444 Columbus Avenue, near 81st Street (769-4444) - *(Oct. 11, 1985) The setting of this West Side restaurant is indeed impressive: The main dining area is a central courtyard to the rear with additional banquettes behind peripheral brick arches. A trio provides chamber music for weekend brunch. Although the service can be inexperienced and awkward, the menu indicates an inventive touch. The choices for brunch include French toast with spiced blueberry sauce and creme fraiche; poached eggs over wild-mushroom hash; grilled chicken cutlet with roast red pepper, almond and garlic sauce, and four-cheese tortellone with parsley cream sauce.

        <p>The kitchen turns out a host of appealing preparations that make it worth recommending. For brunch you might start with a basket of homemade fruit breads and then choose from pancakes and maple syrup with pork sausage, bacon or ham; eggs Hussard, poached on English muffins, with tomato, ham and marchand du vin sauce topped with hollandaise; French toast with orange-brandy butter, and chicken and apple salad with mustard seeds.

RIVER CAFE, #1 Water Steet, Brooklyn (718-522-5200) - ***(July 25, 1986) Situated on a barge on the Brooklyn shore of the East River is this restaurant that offers stunning views of lower Manhattan. Like so much of New American cooking, this cuisine has ingredients that may be home grown, but the chef uses techniques that are largely French. Appetizers are white-bean and lobster soup with garlic essence and grilled onion bread; smoked chicken ham with roast tomatillo salad, and fresh chilled duck foie gras with comice pear and walnut salad.</p>
