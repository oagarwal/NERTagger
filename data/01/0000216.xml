        <p>Larry Smith, the football coach at the University of Arizona, said he was seeking to become the coach at Southern California and that he had met with officials from that school to discuss the job. ''Nothing has been offered to me yet, '' Smith said. ''I was told by U.S.C. officials that a decision would be made by the end of the week. I can't say anything else. Nothing has been settled in any way, shape or form.'' Smith has been considered a potential replacement for Ted Tollner, who was dismissed by the Trojans Dec. 8. Tollner's dismissal becomes effective after today's Florida Citrus Bowl game between the Trojans and Auburn.</p>
