        <p>LEAD: The Economy</p>
        <p>The Economy</p>
        <p>The trade deficit soared to a record $19.2 billion in November, a startling setback that followed three months of improvement. A small fee imposed Dec. 1 on most imported goods, along with rising calls for protectionist legislation, were partly responsible for the renewed deterioration by causing a strong rush in imports. But analysts expressed keen disappointment with the data, which put the trade gap at $159.1 billion for the first 11 months of the year, eclipsing the previous record of $148.5 billion for 1985.  [ Page 1. ]  The dollar fell to a new six-year low against the West German mark as foreign-exchange traders sold the currency in response to the trade news. Gold, in turn, climbed to above $400 an ounce.  [ 51. ]</p>
        <p>Year-end charitable donations surged as many donors around the nation rushed to make gifts before the new tax law went into effect today. Colleges, universities and religious organizations generally reported a marked rise in contributions.  [ 41. ]</p>

        <p>Canada's lumber industry condemned a pact with the U.S. that will set aside a 15 percent American tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax. Politicians also attacked the accord, which applies to Canadian exports worth about $2.9 billion. The dispute had threatened broader U.S.-Canada trade talks.  [ 41. ] Companies</p>
        <p>I.B.M. and Merrill Lynch ended a once-promising venture in computerizing the financial services industry. The failure appeared to be a setback for both companies, which had staked millions of dollars on the highly publicized International Marketnet, which joins a long list of information services that have failed.  [ 41. ]</p>
        <p>USX will take a $300 million charge to retire debt from its $2.9 billion 1982 acquisition of Marathon Oil. USX said the move would trim its financing costs by more than $140 million a year.  [ 41. ]</p>
        <p>First Chicago will buy Beneficial National Bank for $247 million, making it the nation's fifth-largest issuer of credit cards. The sale is part of the Beneficial Corporation's plan to sell $1.4 billion of assets as it restructures to focus on consumer lending.  [ 50. ]</p>
        <p>Hearst bought Esquire magazine as part of the breakup and sale of the publication's parent company, the Esquire Magazine Group. In addition, American Express Publishing purchased New York Woman from the group.  [ 43. ]</p>
        <p>New York State banks may receive guidelines as early as next week from a state agency on how they can legally underwrite securities, an activity generally prohibited by the Fed.  [ 50. ]</p>
        <p>Inland Steel denied it had yet reached an accord with Nippon Steel on a joint venture to make sheet metal.  [ 43. ]</p>

        <p>Pullman-Peabody ended a bid for Joy Manufacturing, which will be acquired by an investor group for $620 million.  [ 43. ] Markets</p>
        <p>The stock market's banner year ended on a weak note. The Dow Jones industrial average posted a gain of 349.14 points - or 22.6 percent - for the year, reaching an all-time peak of 1,955.57 on Dec. 2. But yesterday the blue-chip index fell 12.80 points, to slip below 1,900, at 1,895.81.  [ 41. ]  Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell in shortened trading in the credit markets.  [ 50. ]</p>
