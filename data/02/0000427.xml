        <p>The five Baltimore businessmen who tried two years ago to buy the New Orleans Saints have sent an application to the National Football League for an expansion franchise in Baltimore, where the Colts played until leaving for Indianapolis in 1984. Lawrence R. Rachuba, the spokesman for the group, said that he had sent a letter to Pete Rozelle, the commissioner of the league, and that three members of the group met Tuesday with their lawyer and Herbert J. Belgrad, the chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority. Belgard said that he was awaiting a report from the consultants hired to review the stadium issue, which should contain details of building stadiums for football and baseball or creating a multipurpose stadium for Baltimore. Contruction would not start, Belgard said, until an N.F.L. franchise was awarded and until after the baseball Orioles signed a long-term lease for either a baseball stadium or the baseball part of a multipurpose stadium.</p>
