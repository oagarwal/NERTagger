        <p>The National Semiconductor Corporation, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it lost $5.7 million in its second quarter, narrowed sharply from the $38.3 million loss reported a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended</p>
        <p>Dec. 14 rose 31 percent, to $456.8 million, from $349.2 million a year ago. The second-quarter results included a provision of about $7.5 million related to reductions in employment that were initiated during the quarter.</p>
        <p>''During the second quarter, the Semiconductor Group reported a moderate gain in sales and a major improvement in operating performance as compared to the last year,''</p>
        <p>Charles E. Sporck, National's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''However, operating performance declined compared to the first quarter because of reduced bookings during the summer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sporck added that semiconductor order rates have improved since the summer, and he expects that improvement to continue at a modest level in 1987. He also said continued growth for the company would come from a new generation of National Advanced Systems products, the Hitachi mainframe computers that National sells, as well as new point-of-sale products from its Datachecker unit.</p>
