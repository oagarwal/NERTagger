        <p>LEAD: The Pullman-Peabody Company said today that it had dropped its unsolicited bid to acquire the Joy Manufacturing Company, which has agreed instead to be purchased by an investor group for $35 a share, or $620 million.</p>
        <p>The Pullman-Peabody Company said today that it had dropped its unsolicited bid to acquire the Joy Manufacturing Company, which has agreed instead to be purchased by an investor group for $35 a share, or $620 million.</p>
        <p>Pullman-Peabody had started a $31-a-share tender offer for Joy on Dec. 2, and later proposed to sweeten the bid to $34 a share. But Joy rejected both offers as inadequate and accepted the investor group's bid on Dec. 22. Under its agreement with</p>
        <p>Joy, Pullman-Peabody said it would tender the nearly one million Joy common shares it already owned to the investor group, which was formed by Adler &amp; Shaykin, a New York investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts.</p>
        <p>The agreement also calls for litigation between the companies to be dropped, and for Joy to pay $750,000 to Pullman-Peabody to help cover Pullman-Peabody's expenses in connection with its failed offer.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh-based Joy is a maker of oilfield and petroleum equipment and coal-mining machinery. Pullman-Peabody, based in Princeton, supplies material-handling and food service equipment, and makes components for the aerospace and communications industries.</p>
        <p>The investor group's tender offer for Joy's stock is due to expire Jan. 26. Joy's stock closed at $34.75 a share today, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
