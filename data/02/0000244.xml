        <p>LEAD: Around and around and around they went - gurgling or giggling, gleefully but politely, as befits glamorous partygoers 3 months to 13 years old.</p>
        <p>Around and around and around they went - gurgling or giggling, gleefully but politely, as befits glamorous partygoers 3 months to 13 years old.</p>
        <p>The occasion was a party given by Herald Center, Broadway at 34th Street, for the Ford Kids, the children's division of Ford Models. The place was the center's fifth floor, smack in the middle of which is a bulb-blazing, mirror-decorated carrousel.</p>
        <p>When the kids - the guests of honor, their brothers, sisters, friends and young-at-heart parents -weren't aboard the carrousel, they could be found oohing and ahing at the feats of Jim Brown, a magician, or gobbling hot dogs in the Carrousel Party Room. (The center rents the room for celebrations, $200 for three hours on weekends and $150 for three hours on weekdays. The carrousel, free to the public, is open from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily except Sunday, when the hours are noon to 6 P.M.) Five United States marines were there, too, to pick up gifts donated to Toys for Tots.</p>
        <p>As for the youngsters, they wore their party best: the girls in velvet and lace, ruffles, frills and flounces, national costumes, black patent Mary Janes and fashion-forward footwear. The boys sported blazers or sweaters, baseball caps and coordinated bow ties and suspenders. The only thing missing, in fact, were some front teeth.</p>
