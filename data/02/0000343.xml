        <p>LEAD: President Reagan's new budget proposes $1.8 trillion in military spending in the next five years but would slash Federal farm aid by more than half and sharply curtail the growth of many other domestic programs over the same period.</p>
        <p>President Reagan's new budget proposes $1.8 trillion in military spending in the next five years but would slash Federal farm aid by more than half and sharply curtail the growth of many other domestic programs over the same period.</p>
        <p>Confidential documents with details of the budget to be submitted to Congress Monday show that Mr. Reagan will propose an overall budget of $1,024.3 billion for the fiscal year 1988, with a deficit of $107.8 billion, just below the target set by law for the year.</p>
        <p>Congress, with Democrats in control of both houses, is likely to discard much of Mr. Reagan's budget, even though he has modified some of his earlier proposals to take account of the intense political opposition they encountered. $20 Billion Military Increases For example, he proposes a slight cut in the budget for buying military weapons and equipment, from $85.8 billion in the current fiscal year to $84 billion in the fiscal year 1988, which begins Oct. 1. This is $57 billion less than the spending level Mr. Reagan envisioned for 1988 just two years ago.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the overall military budget would increase by about $20 billion a year for each of the next five years, to $312 billion in 1988, $332.4 billion in 1989 and $396.9 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>Proposed cuts in commodity price supports and other farm aid would be even bigger than Administration officials indicated last week. Federal spending for these programs would drop from $25.3 billion this year to $21.3 billion in 1988, then to $10.4 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>Congress has considered major changes in farm programs. But it seems unlikely to approve all the proposed cuts, having rejected similar ideas when it passed a five-year farm bill in 1985.</p>
        <p>Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor, would continue growing. But to slow the growth, Mr. Reagan proposes cutbacks that would save a total of $6.5 billion in 1988, and $58.4 billion over five years, from the amount that would spent under current law.</p>
        <p>The proposed cutbacks, according to the budget documents, include changes in the Medicare law to trim $3.5 billionfrom Federal payments to hospitals and $1.2 billion from payments to physicians and other medical suppliers in the next fiscal year. The Administration is also proposing legislation to raise premiums and other charges to beneficiaries, so as to increase collections by $570 million in 1988 and $15.7 billion over five years. Some Increases Are Planned</p>
        <p>In the Medicaid program, Mr. Reagan proposes legislative changes that would save the Federal Government $1.3 billion next year and $19.5 billion over five years, according to the budget documents.</p>
        <p>Even with the proposed changes, the cost of Medicaid would rise, from $26.7 billion this year to $32.5 billion in 1992, an increase of 22 percent. And the Administration sees a 46 percent increase in Medicare spending, from $71.6 billion this year to $104.3 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan proposes to increase spending for Federal law enforcement, tax collections, space flight and the National Science Foundation, according to the documents. He seeks to reduce spending for food stamps, child nutrition programs, welfare and support of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>
        <p>Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who serves on the Appropriations Committee, said, ''The President and other officials discredit the budget process by not sending us serious proposals.'' In past years, he said, ''they sent us proposals they knew their own party wouldn't even buy.''</p>
        <p>The budget shows deficits declining steadily until 1992, when the President projects a surplus of $12.3 billion. Under a law enacted a year ago, the budget is supposed to be balanced by 1991. Surplus Termed 'Pot of Gold'</p>
        <p>Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a research and advocacy group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, said the projected surplus was no more genuine than ''the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.'' He said that ''Congress will have to start writing a budget from scratch'' because the Administration's proposals appeared to contain ''a lot of gimmicks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan anticipates a deficit of $173.2 billion in the current fiscal year, down from the record $220.7 billion in 1986.</p>
        <p>These are some highlights of the President's budget, as reflected in the documents:</p>
        <p>* Spending for the space shuttle and other space flight programs, $4.3 billion this year, would rise to $5.6 billion next year and $6.9 billion in 1989. For each of the following three years, it would be around $6.6 billion.</p>
        <p>* Funds for urban parks and historic preservation would be reduced from $29 million this year to $14 million next year, then eliminated.</p>
        <p>* No new loans would be made to build housing for the elderly and handicapped. The Administration proposes to eliminate the loan program in favor of housing vouchers, a kind of scrip that could be used by low-income tenants.</p>
        <p>* Federal aid to college students would be reduced from $7.3 billion this year to $5.5 billion in 1988. Spending on vocational and adult education would be slashed to $524 million, from $1 billion. Spending for elementary and secondary education would rise by $659 million, to $7.2 billion in 1988.</p>
        <p>* Pay raises for the Government's civilian employees would cost $678 million next year and $1.6 billion in 1989. The budget assumes a 2 percent raise that would take effect in January 1988 and another raise later.</p>
        <p>* The Government would get $3.3 billion in the next two years from the sale of the naval petroleum reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo. In addition, the Government would get $14 billion if Congress approved the President's proposal to sell regional power marketing agencies over the next five years.</p>
        <p>* Federal aid for urban mass transit systems would be cut from $3.5 billion this year to $1.6 billion in 1988 and stay at that level through 1990. But the budget for air traffic control, aircraft inspections and airport improvement, carried out by the Federal Aviation Administration, would rise from $4.8 billion this year to $5.8 billion in 1988.</p>
        <p>* Urban development action grants, which are used to stimulate economic development, and the Legal Services Corporation, which finances legal aid for poor people, would be eliminated. Congress has repeatedly rejected Mr. Reagan's efforts to end these programs.</p>
        <p>* The Government would get $600 million next year by auctioning radio frequencies used for paging devices, cellular telephones and some satellite communications. The proposal is subject to approval by Congress, which has been indifferent to the idea.</p>
        <p>* Federal spending on food stamps would decline from $12.7 billion this year to $12.5 billion next year. The budget for child nutrition and related programs would be reduced to $6.1 billion, from $6.6 billion.</p>
        <p>* The budget for ''family support payments,'' including Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare program, would be reduced from $10.6 billion this year to $9.8 billion in 1988. Mr. Reagan proposes again to eliminate the work incentive program, which provides job training to welfare recipients.</p>
        <p>* The budget for Federal law enforcement, including the work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would rise from $4.6 billion this year to $5.2 billion next year. The Internal Revenue Service would get $5 billion for collecting taxes in 1988, an increase of $600 million from this year.</p>
        <p>The President proposes to increas spending for international affairs, including foreign aid, from $14.6 billion this year to $15.2 billion next year and $18.1 billion in 1989.</p>
        <p>The budget for electricity-producing programs of the Tennessee Valley Authority would decline to $318 million in 1988, from $806 million this year.  THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET</p>
