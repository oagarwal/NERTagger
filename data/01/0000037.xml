        <p>LEAD: A WALK in the snow or mud can make for wet and dirty shoes and boots. However, some devices can keep boots clean and dry them more efficiently than resting them on a radiator. The Boot 'n Shoe from Sporty's Tool Shop removes mud, snow or ice from dirty shoes and boots. The Boot 'n Shoe brush, a combination brush - with stiff, plastic bristles - and a steel scraper, costs $33.75.</p>

        <p>A WALK in the snow or mud can make for wet and dirty shoes and boots. However, some devices can keep boots clean and dry them more efficiently than resting them on a radiator. The Boot 'n Shoe from Sporty's Tool Shop removes mud, snow or ice from dirty shoes and boots. The Boot 'n Shoe brush, a combination brush - with stiff, plastic bristles - and a steel scraper, costs $33.75.</p>
        <p>Sporty's also sells a shoe and boot dryer ($82.50) that dries two pairs at a time. The unit, from Norway, is wall-mounted and has four 24-inch coils that direct warm air through the shoes. A timer can be set for one minute to two hours. Another dryer, this one for $37.50, will dry tall shoes - ski boots, hiking boots and high rubber boots - overnight. Sporty's catalogue can be ordered from Clermont Airport, Batavia, Ohio 45103, telephone 513-732-2411.</p>
        <p>Smaller, portable electric boot dryers, sold through the Eddie Bauer catalogue, fit both men's and women's shoes and dry boots overnight. The manufacturer says they are designed not to crack or shrivel leather footwear. The aluminum dryers cost $22 from Eddie Bauer, Fifth Union, Post Office Box 3700, Seattle, Wash. 98124; 800-426-8020.</p>
        <p>A cast-iron boot scraper in the shape of a dog costs $33 from the Cumberland General Store, Route 3, Crossville, Tenn. 38555; 615-484-8481. A cricket bootjack, to help remove sturdy boots, is $7.70.</p>
