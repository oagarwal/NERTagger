        <p>LEAD: Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home operator, has announced a restructuring program that includes the sale of some long-term care facilities, the sale of most of its retirement living centers and the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of common stock.</p>
        <p>Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home operator, has announced a restructuring program that includes the sale of some long-term care facilities, the sale of most of its retirement living centers and the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of common stock.</p>
        <p>Beverly, based in Pasadena, Calif., also announced the acquisition of 69 long-term care facilities with about 7,500 beds in Arkansas and Texas from a subsidiary of Stephens Inc. Stephens will get about $100 million stated value of a new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock for the facilities, which Beverly leases.</p>
        <p>The restructuring plan calls for Beverly to slow its acquisition program from 13,500 beds annually to between 3,000 and 5,000 beds in 1987 and includes the sale of some of the company's durable medical equipment operations. Robert Van Tuyle, chairman and chief executive, said the company planned to focus on its long-term care facilities.</p>
