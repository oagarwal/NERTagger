        <p>LEAD: More than 20 black youths, many chanting ''Howard Beach, Howard Beach,'' beat up six riders on the subway early yesterday before some of them were seized by the transit police as they fled from the train, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>More than 20 black youths, many chanting ''Howard Beach, Howard Beach,'' beat up six riders on the subway early yesterday before some of them were seized by the transit police as they fled from the train, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>A Transit Authority spokesman, John Cunningham, said there were indications that the attackers did not all know each other but came together in what he described as ''primarily a rampage and robbery spree.''</p>
        <p>The incident occurred on a northbound A train at about 1:20 A.M. shortly after the train left 42d Street, and the suspects were caught at the 59th Street station after they began to assault a newsdealer, Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
        <p>Three men and three women on the train, all of them white except for a man described as Indian or Pakistani, received bruises and lacerations, Mr. Cunningham said. The victims, all described as between 18 and 22 years of age, declined medical treatment, he added. The newsdealer, who received minor injuries, was also said to be Indian or Pakistani.</p>
        <p>Seven male suspects, all but one between the ages of 16 and 18, were arrested, while an eighth person, a 14-year-old boy, was released. About 15 other people, some of them women, got away, Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
