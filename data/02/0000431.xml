        <p>Jimmy Johnson is the Madonna of college football these days. Like the rock star, he's hot, totally awesome. If there is a major coaching job open - and of course there always is, at this time of year - his name is at the top of everybody's list of candidates, real or rumored. First it was Texas, then Southern Cal, now Alabama.</p>
        <p>Johnson was asked about the latest vacancy sign the other day. ''How big is Tuscaloosa?'' replied the Miami coach, who is said to favor the brights lights of the big city. ''You can't go scuba diving in Tuscaloosa.''</p>
        <p>As he had before, Johnson insisted that he had no plans to leave the Hurricanes. ''At first, all of this was flattering,'' he said. ''Then it became an irritation. Now it's humorous.'' Flattering and irritating, O.K. But humorous? In the fickle world of big-time college coaching, where a sub-par season or two can get you run out of town, Johnson should surely enjoy the laughs while he can, just as Fred Akers and Ted Tollner once did.</p>
