        <p>The Yankees announced yesterday they had dismissed Dom Scala, their bullpen catcher, and replaced him with Mike Sennell, a catcher in the Yankees organization from 1983-85. There were reports that Scala was discharged because too much of his time was being taken up by his own business, which is the manufacture of jewelry carrying the logos of major leagues teams. Woody Woodward, the general manager, said the decision to replace Scala was ''strictly a baseball decision. ''Mike was a catcher in our organization for over three years and then served as a bullpen catcher for us at Albany in 1985 and at Columbus last year, '' Woodward said. ''He has earned and deserves the opportunity to handle that role for the Yankees this season.''  SPORTS PEOPLE</p>
