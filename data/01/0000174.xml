        <p>LEAD: Crude oil futures touched the $18-a-barrel mark yesterday for the first time since February, continuing a run-up touched off by the recent agreement of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production. The gains were trimmed a bit near the close.</p>
        <p>Crude oil futures touched the $18-a-barrel mark yesterday for the first time since February, continuing a run-up touched off by the recent agreement of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production. The gains were trimmed a bit near the close.</p>
        <p>''Prices continue to advance on the belief that the OPEC agreement is going to work,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc. Although the upward price move had ultimately met resistance, he said, ''the market is still giving OPEC a strong vote of confidence for its efforts.''</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 29 cents higher, with the February contract at $17.94 a barrel; heating oil was 0.76 cent to 1.11 cents higher, with February at 49.95 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.70 cent to 1.24 cents higher, with February at 49.34 cents a gallon.</p>
        <p>Precious metals futures also surged yesterday.</p>
        <p>The metals were helped by the strong advance of energy futures, signaling the possibility of greater inflation, according to Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. She said that relatively thin trading accentuated the moves.</p>
        <p>Gold futures soared as the dollar weakened after the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit totaled a record $19.2 billion in November, she said. The market had been expecting the figure to be near $13 billion.</p>
        <p>At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $14.50 to $15.10 higher, with the contract for delivery in January at $404.90 an ounce. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $11.70 to $12.70 higher, with the January contract at $470.70 an ounce.</p>
