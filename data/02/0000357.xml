        <p>LEAD: An agreement has been reached between service employees and building owners, averting a strike set for today that threatened to affect the heat, hot water, trash removal and elevator service at more than 1,000 city office buildings, officials said.</p>
        <p>An agreement has been reached between service employees and building owners, averting a strike set for today that threatened to affect the heat, hot water, trash removal and elevator service at more than 1,000 city office buildings, officials said.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday morning, after an all-night bargaining session, representatives of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations in Manhattan and Local 32B-32J Service Employees International Union reached a new three-year labor agreement, according to Ned Steele, a spokesman for the board.</p>
        <p>He had no immediate details of the contract.</p>
        <p>The agreement averted the strike in which thousands of porters, office cleaners, elevator starters, boiler operators and guards were planning to walk out at 12:01 A.M. today.</p>
        <p>Although the union represents some 65,000 workers, only those in commercial buildings had threatened to strike.</p>
        <p>No union official was available yesterday for comment.</p>
