        <p>Horse Racing Gene's Lady Is Winner: For the second year in a row, Eugene V. Klein's Gene's Lady took the Interborough Handicap at Aqueduct. Carrying 118 pounds, the 6-year-old daughter of What a Pleasure-Lady T. V. raced six furlongs under Frank Lovato Jr. in 1:10 3/5 on the fast track yesterday and came from off the pace to reach the wire a neck ahead of Sherry Mary. Capp It Off, the favorite, was another neck back after leading most of the way. Gene's Lady earned $53,640 and returned $7.20 for $2 to win. N.H.L. Capitals 4, Penguins 3: Mike Gartner scored on a breakaway at 1 minute 30 seconds of overtime for his second goal of the game, giving Washington the victory in Landover, Md.

Bernhard Langer of West Germany, Davis Love and Hale Irwin were three strokes back in the 12-player field.(AP) Calcavecchia At It Again: Mark Calcavecchia, one of golf's best comeback performers in 1986, opened the new year by shooting a three-under-par 67 at Carmel Valley, Calif., to land in a three-way tie for the lead after two rounds of the $250,000 Spalding Invitational. Calcavecchia, Al Geiberger and Ron Stelten had 36-hole totals of 134.(AP) Road Racing Draddy Is First: Vincent Draddy of North Tarrytown, N.Y., successfully defended his title in the New York Road Runners Club New Year's Eve midnight five-mile run in 23 minutes 18 seconds in Central Park.
