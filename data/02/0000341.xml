        <p>LEAD: The transit police are investigating how a man with a fractured skull came to be lying on the subway tracks of a Queens station, a spokesman said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The transit police are investigating how a man with a fractured skull came to be lying on the subway tracks of a Queens station, a spokesman said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The man, Dave Webb, 26 years old, of 130-32 Laurelton Parkway in the Rosedale section, was taken to the Queens Hospital Center, where he was listed in critical condition yesterday, said Elaine Likari, a hospital administrator.</p>
        <p>A flagman at the 179th Street Station at Hillside Avenue saw Mr. Webb lying on the road bed at about 5:15 A.M. and tried to warn an incoming E train that he was there, Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
        <p>Although the train was able to slow down, one car passed over him without striking him, he said.</p>
        <p>''We have not been able to determine how he sustained his injuries, whether he was hit by a previous train or involved in an altercation,'' said a Transit Authority spokesman, John Cunningham.</p>
        <p>In addition to the fractured skull, the victim also had a broken arm and lacerations, he said.</p>
