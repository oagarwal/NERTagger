        <p>Ridge Vineyards Inc., a California winery, has merged with an American subsidiary of the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company for an undisclosed amount. Founded in 1959, Ridge is in the Santa Cruz Mountains.</p>
        <p>Otsuka, a $1.5 billion company based in Japan, produces pharmaceutical and nutritional products and has recently begun a small wine-making operation near Mount Fuji. The Ridge sale, announced on Wednesday, is Otsuka's first wine operation in the United States.</p>
        <p>William H. Curtiss, Ridge's president, said that the winery's four founding families had decided to sell because of pending changes in capital gains taxation and that Otsuka met their condition ''not to sell to anyone who wouldn't pledge to keep Ridge as Ridge.''</p>
        <p>Ridge, which is known for its zinfandel and cabernet sauvignon, produces between 35,000 and 40,000 cases of wine annually. Paul F. Perret, president of Otsuka USA Inc., said the Japanese company already had several ventures with American companies.</p>
