        <p>Michael Brooks, who has been out of the National Basketball Association the last two seasons with a knee injury, returned yesterday when he signed a 10-day contract with the Indiana Pacers. The former LaSalle forward was San Diego's first-round draft choice in 1980 and played four seasons with the Clippers, averaging 13.7 points and 6.6 rebounds for 293 games. Brooks was playing with the Tampa Bay Thrillers of the Continental Basketball Association this season, averaging 22.7 points and 10.8 rebounds. He will fill a roster spot created two days ago when Herb Williams was placed on the injured list with bruised ribs he suffered when he struck a basket support in a game against Detroit Dec. 23. Brooks's signing was the second of a C.B.A. player by the Pacers this week, the other being Peter Verhoeven, who played for five seasons as a forward in the N.B.A. and was averaging 9.8 points and 8.4 rebounds with the Charleston Gunners. . . . The Boston Celtics have signed Conner Henry for a 10-day tryout. The 23-year-old guard was a Houston Rockets' fourth-round draft choice last year out of the University of California at Santa Barbara and he played 18 games with the Rockets before he was released.</p>
