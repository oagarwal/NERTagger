        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article on boyhood effeminacy and later homosexuality (Science Times, Dec. 16) forewarns your readers that Yale University Press is about to publish an incredibly anachronous book (''The 'Sissy Boy Syndrome' and the Development of Homosexuality'') by Dr. Richard Green of the University of California, Los Angeles. In this era when women are accomplished engineers, lawyers, heads of investment firms, contractors, firefighters, police officers and garbage collectors, it has been proved that childhood dolls and mud pies are unreliable indicators of future sexual or professional orientation.</p>
        <p>Particularly offensive to the wife of a composer is Dr. Green's implication that musical gifts are not associated with traditional masculinity. What about the 80-year-old conductor Pierre Monteux, arriving late for a Boston Symphony benefit concert with a loving arm around his ebullient wife: ''Sorry, we were being naughty!'' Or Ralph Vaughan Williams? Or Arthur Rubinstein? Or Richard Wagner? Or the rest of the conventionally passionate tribe? Composing was so often considered an exclusively masculine province that gifted women were published under their husbands' names or with masculine pseudonyms.</p>
        <p>Dr. Green's use of ''sissy boy'' is insulting to the youngster who sees nothing desirable in bloody noses and black eyes, but who has a matchless gift for musical expression. At Interlochen, the national music camp, we have often broken up a baseball game to extricate a soloist for a piano or harp concerto, and I know at least one teen-age composer who's a soccer and tennis champion. If they loathe gang combat, professional football or prizefighting, they are more likely to come later to oppose spending billions for international warfare. That's heroic, not ''sissy.''
