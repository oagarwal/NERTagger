        <p>LEAD: Saudi Arabia introduced its long-awaited budget today, cutting spending for 1987 by 6 percent and projecting a deficit of 52.7 billion riyals, or about $14 billion, to be funded out of reserves.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia introduced its long-awaited budget today, cutting spending for 1987 by 6 percent and projecting a deficit of 52.7 billion riyals, or about $14 billion, to be funded out of reserves.</p>
        <p>Oil revenues will cover only about 40 percent of expenditures, and military spending will again take up more than a third of the budget. Politically sensitive subsidies on basic food items were broadly unchanged. In a speech Monday, King Fahd had warned that the budget would involve cuts, but he reassured the Saudi people that key subsidies would not be touched.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was hit hard this year by the fall in crude prices and twice postponed its budget, originally due to be announced last March. It has now redefined its fiscal year to coincide with the Western calendar, although Wednesday's budget was officially designated 1407-08 under the Islamic system.</p>
        <p>A Finance Ministry statement, distributed to newspapers in the kingdom by the Saudi Press Agency, said 1987 spending would total 170 billion riyals, or about $45.3 billion, and revenue 117.3 billion riyals, about $31.3 billion.</p>
