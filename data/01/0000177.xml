        <p>LEAD: Two employees of a Bronx check-cashing service were found shot to death Tuesday night in their street-level corner store in what the police called an apparent robbery.</p>
        <p>Two employees of a Bronx check-cashing service were found shot to death Tuesday night in their street-level corner store in what the police called an apparent robbery.</p>
        <p>The victims, employees of the Home Check Cashing Corporation, were found dead inside the locked and shuttered store at 25 West 170th Street, at Inwood Avenue, shortly after 11:30 P.M. Both died of shotgun wounds, the police said.</p>
        <p>The victims, Valdamar Barrea, 40 years old, and Varghese Ninan, 35, both of Yonkers, were found behind an intact bullet-proof partition, according to the police, who said it was unclear how the intruder got behind the barrier. The police said they believed they were shot at about 6 P.M., the store's usual closing hour.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman, Officer Peter O'Donnell, said the police had been summoned by a company supervisor who saw the employees' cars parked outside.</p>
        <p>A safe was found open with only coins in it, the police said, adding that an audit was being performed to see if any cash was taken.</p>
