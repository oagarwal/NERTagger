        <p>College Basketball Notre Dame 63, Maryland 50: Scott Hicks scored 14 points, and David Rivers and Donald Royal added 13 each, as Notre Dame held off a brief Maryland rally last night in College Park, Md. The victory was the sixth in a row for Notre Dame after two losses to start the season. Maryland suffered its first loss in three games. Notre Dame held a 42-31 edge in rebounds as Maryland played the final 26 minutes without its center, Derrick Lewis, the leading rebounder and scorer for the Terps, who sprained an ankle late in the first half. After leading by 28-19 at halftime, the Irish stretched their advantage to 46-31 with 7:43 remaining before John Johnson sparked a Maryland rally. Johnson sank two shots from 3-point range and Greg Nared added another to pull the Terps within 7 point, at 52-45, before Notre Dame ran off 9 consecutive points. Johnson led Maryland with 15 points and a freshman, Steve Hood, added 13.(AP) N.H.L. Red Wings 6, Flames 4: In Detroit, Gerard Gallant scored his 16th goal of the season and set up another goal by Randy Ladouceur in a 2:16 span early in the final period to help Detroit get the victory. Detroit extended its unbeaten streak to four games, with three victories and one tie. (AP) Horse Racing Fabulous Move Wins: Fabulous Move, the only New York-bred in a field of 10, held off the late charge of Buckley Boy to score a head victory in the $90,000 Display Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Aqueduct yesterday. It was another 5 1/2 lengths to Beat It Kid, one of two fillies among the starters. Feeling Gallant, the favorite, finished fast after lagging early and was fourth. Fabulous Move was saddled by his owner-trainer, Oscar Barrera, who was honored earlier in the day as New York's leading trainer for the fourth straight year. The 4-year-old son of Le Fabuleux-Petite Luci carried 111 pounds and was ridden by Chris Antley. He earned $54,000 and returned $18.80 for $2 to win as the third choice. He went two and a quarter miles on the fast track in 3:56 to register his seventh victory in 32 starts this year.</p>
