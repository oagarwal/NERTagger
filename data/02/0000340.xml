        <p>LEAD: More than 400 current and former members of the Church of Scientology have filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the church, accusing it of trying to compromise or pay off two Florida judges and siphon $100 million to foreign bank accounts.</p>
        <p>More than 400 current and former members of the Church of Scientology have filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the church, accusing it of trying to compromise or pay off two Florida judges and siphon $100 million to foreign bank accounts.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed Wednesday by Lawrence Levy, a lawyer, contends that church officials or their representatives committed fraud and breached fiduciary duties. It says information obtained in purportedly confidential ''auditing'' sessions with a lie detector-like device was used ''for purposes of blackmail and extortion.''</p>
        <p>The suit seeks an injunction and $1 billion in punitive damages, plus unspecified general damages.</p>
        <p>The defendants include Ken Hoden and Heber Jentzsch, two Scientology leaders; David Miscavige, chairman of Author Services, which publishes the works of L. Ron Hubbard, the Scientology founder; Mary Sue Hubbard, his widow, Mr. Hubbard's estate and more than 100 other unnamed people.</p>
