        <p>LEAD: Fiscal mismanagement, health and security risks and staff shortages are widespread in the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles, according to a report by the Office of the State Auditor.</p>
        <p>Fiscal mismanagement, health and security risks and staff shortages are widespread in the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles, according to a report by the Office of the State Auditor.</p>
        <p>''There is a lack of assurance that records are accurately maintained, that transactions are properly entered into the system and that all revenues are collected and remitted to the state,'' the 17-page report said.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the Attorney General's office, which oversees the department, could not be reached for comment. But in a formal response contained in the report, Attorney General W. Cary Edwards and the department director, Glenn Paulsen, wrote they are making progress to correct the problems.</p>
        <p>The department has been criticized in the past because of long lines at its offices, computer malfunctions, paperwork backlogs and impolite workers.</p>
        <p>The auditor's report found that the agency failed to reconcile its revenue documents with those of the Treasury Department, update inventory records and deposit cash receipts in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>Because of staff shortages, the report said, the department failed to complete required field audits and has ''haphazardly'' stored certain documents.</p>
