        <p>The Union Carbide Corporation said today that it had completed the previously announced sale of its Danbury headquarters and its 650-acre headquarters site to a private investment group for a total of $340.5 million. The corporation said it had also completed the agreement to lease back its headquarters buiding for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Union Carbide said it expects a pre-tax gain in excess of $100 million over the next 20 years from the sale, but added that it will have no material effect on net income in 1986. The company said the transaction includes an agreement to participate in a limited partnership with the Related Companies Inc. of New York, a real estate development concern, for the future development of about 540 acres of the Danbury site. The development is expected to take place over 14 years.</p>
