        <p>Q.You recently recommended storing a power lawn mower indoors in winter. However, I prefer not to store anything indoors that contains gasoline. I don't have a garage, but I am storing the mower in an unheated utility shed. Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply. One of the first things recommended when storing a power mower is to drain all gasoline from the tank, carburetor and fuel lines. However, storing the mower inside a cold shed will do it no harm and should not affect the engine in any way. Q.We recently moved into a house with an unheated dirt basement. We found firewood stored there, covered with mold. A strong odor of mold pervades the house. We are removing the wood. What else can we do to get rid of the moldy odor? A.First, cover the dirt floor with heavy sheet plastic or heavy tar paper. Overlap strips at least 6 inches and lap them up onto the walls 8 to 10 inches on all sides. Hold the plastic in place with bricks or cement blocks. Be sure the basement area is well ventilated with louvered openings on opposite sides for cross ventilation. The openings should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of unobstructed area for every 1,500 square feet of floor area in the basement (screens and louvers over the vents cut the actual size of the opening by half). Q.My family room has a concrete slab floor that is very cold in the winter. It is about a foot lower than the first floor, so I may add a ''false'' insulated floor on top of the slab. I plan to put down 2-by-4's with 5/8-inch plywood on top, filling the spaces between the 2-by-4's with fiberglass insulation. The insulation will have a foil vapor barrier on one side. Where should the vapor barrier go - on the bottom, against the concrete, or on the top, directly under the plywood? A.Always put the vapor barrier on the warmer side of the insulation - the side facing the heated area in the winter. Your vapor barrier should be on top of the insulation, directly under the plywood. Q.Our concrete basement walls are covered with a white crystalline substance that looks something like a powdery dusting of snow. After we washed a portion of the wall off with bleach and water the substance seemed to ''grow'' back. What can be used to remove this? A.This substance is the result of efflorescence. It is caused by the release of alkaline salts that leach out of the concrete when there is dampness present and when there are excess alkalies in the masonry.</p>
        <p>You can get rid of the powder by washing with a mild solution of muriatic acid (one part acid to five parts water). This neutralizes the alkalies and washes off the white powder.</p>
        <p>There is no guarantee that the efflorescence won't come back, unless you can eliminate the dampness. Applying a masonry paint or sealer sometimes helps, but not always.</p>
