        <p>LEAD: When the new Senate convenes next Tuesday in the opening session of the 100th Congress, the body will be under the control of the Democrats and, as a result, will have a new parliamentarian.</p>
        <p>When the new Senate convenes next Tuesday in the opening session of the 100th Congress, the body will be under the control of the Democrats and, as a result, will have a new parliamentarian.</p>
        <p>The current parliamentarian, Robert B. Dove, is something of a fixture in the Senate after 20 years' service, first as an assistant and then as chief parliamentarian since 1981. But he was drawn into a contretemps with the Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd, then in the minority, a few months ago on a complex procedural question after a cloture vote. The matter took a day and a half to resolve; by the time it was over, a ruling based on Mr. Dove's interpretation of procedure was overturned by an overwhelming 92-to-5 vote on the floor. Mr. Byrd, himself a master parliamentarian, is now the majority leader, and Mr. Dove is out of a job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dove will be succeeded by Alan S. Frumin, now an assistant parliamentarian, who will officially assume his new duties Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Senator Byrd himself declined to discuss the reasons behind the change, but did take time in a telephone interview to bat down a rumor he was also planning to replace the Senate chaplain, Richard Halverson.</p>
        <p>''I've never thought of firing the chaplain,'' the Senator said. ''In my view, the Lord's work is a little above partisan politics.''  WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING</p>
