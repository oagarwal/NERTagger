        <p>The Allied Stores Corporation's shareholders have approved the $3.5 billion acquisition of the big New York-based retailer by the Campeau Corporation. Toronto-based Campeau's takeover plan specified that each share of Allied common stock that Campeau does not already own will be converted into $69 in cash if the takeover was completed by yesterday.</p>
        <p>Campeau, one of Canada's biggest real estate developers, already owned 27.9 million Allied shares as of yesterday. It had bought 25.8 million shares in a block for $67 a share, for a total price of about $1.73 billion. The price paid for the other 2 million or so shares was not available, a Campeau spokesman said. There were 52.3 million shares of Allied stock outstanding on Dec. 1, so Campeau had some 24.4 million shares left to purchase at the agreed-upon price of $69 apiece, or about $1.68 billion. The acquisition - based on the amounts Campeau has already spent and will spend -will cost about $3.5 billion.</p>
