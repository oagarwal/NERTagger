        <p>The Justice Department moved to block the pending acquisition of the Bradford-White Corporation by the Rheem Manufacturing Company on antitrust grounds. The department said it would institute a civil antitrust suit to challenge the transaction.</p>
        <p>New York City-based Rheem is the nation's third-largest manufacturer of residential water heaters. Philadelphia-based Bradford-White is the fifth largest. Charles Rule, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, said the lawsuit would assert that the proposed acquisition would lessen competition in the manufacture and sale of residential water heaters in the United States. In 1985, sales of residential water heaters in the nation totaled about $915 million. Rheem and Bradford-White had combined sales of about $262 million.</p>
