        <p>LEAD: A second man has been charged with felony murder in the death of a 63-year-old New Canaan woman.</p>
        <p>A second man has been charged with felony murder in the death of a 63-year-old New Canaan woman.</p>
        <p>The victim, Ann Viner, was found drowned in her swimming pool on Dec. 10. The second suspect is Terrance Boyd, 20, of New Canaan. State's Attorney Eugene Callahan said the new charge was based on a statement that the other suspect, Tyrone Wilson, had made to the police.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd and Mr. Wilson are to appear in State Superior Court in Stamford on Feb. 2. They face identical felony charges stemming from the murder, the burglary of the Viner house and the theft of the Viner car.</p>
        <p>The two are being held in the Bridgeport Correctional Center, each in lieu of $500,000 bail.</p>
