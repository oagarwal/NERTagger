        <p>LEAD: KIRK LIGHTSEY, a pianist with a firm, positive approach when he is playing alone, is leading a trio that has the same kind of outgoing confidence, at Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, through tomorrow.</p>
        <p>KIRK LIGHTSEY, a pianist with a firm, positive approach when he is playing alone, is leading a trio that has the same kind of outgoing confidence, at Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, through tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In his ability to be strongly rhythmic at any tempo and in any mood, Mr. Lightsey is reminiscent of Erroll Garner, although his style is only occasionally in the Garner tradition. Even then, Mr. Lightsey is not as dramatically exaggerated as Mr. Garner could be.</p>
        <p>He is, however, brimming with contrasts. He takes ''Lover'' from a gentle but firm whisper and raises it to a merry bit of dancing, churning with gaiety and given added intensity from implied breaks that he throws in on the fly.</p>
        <p>It is a performance shaped as much by his two colleagues - the guitarist Attila Zoller and the bassist Cecil McBee - as by Mr. Lightsey. Mr. Zoller contributes a dashing single-string solo that impels Mr. Lightsey to a more ebullient level while Mr. McBee emerges from the height of the Zoller-Lightsey collaboration with a stately, beautifully structured solo that is a commanding contrast.</p>
        <p>The trio is made up of three strong, individual voices, balanced so it moves as an ensemble even when one or the other is soloing. Mr. Lightsey's solos can be complex but so subtle that the complexity does not call attention to itself. A melodic flow and a rhythmic pulse are constantly evident even on a slow ballad, when an undercurrent of double time may appear to pin down a positive beat.</p>
