        <p>LEAD: The Israeli Interior Minister submitted his resignation today to protest a Supreme Court ruling ordering him to list an American immigrant who underwent a Reform conversion as a Jew in the population registry.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Interior Minister submitted his resignation today to protest a Supreme Court ruling ordering him to list an American immigrant who underwent a Reform conversion as a Jew in the population registry.</p>
        <p>The resignation of the official, Yitzhak Peretz, will go into effect next Tuesday at the earliest, the Israeli radio said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, political efforts are being made to persuade Rabbi Peretz to reverse his decision, even though his absence will not threaten the future of the national unity Government, since the Shas Party of which he is a member is not a crucial partner in the coalition. The Shas Party is predominantly made up of Orthodox Sephardic Jews.</p>
        <p>''The High Court of Justice demanded that I list a non-Jew as a Jew,'' Rabbi Peretz told the Israeli radio. ''As a Jew and a rabbi loyal to the tradition and Bible of Israel, I have declared and declare again that my hand will never ever sign for a fraudulent conversion that was not conducted according to the Halakha.''</p>
        <p>Halakha is the code of Jewish law. The American immigrant, Shoshana Miller, was converted by a Reform rabbi in Colorado Springs before she came to live in Israel.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Miller immigrated and applied for identity papers, Rabbi Peretz agreed to list her as Jewish, but added alongside her religion the word ''converted.'' The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Dec. 2 that the additional word was illegal and that Rabbi Peretz must relist Ms. Miller merely as a Jew.</p>
