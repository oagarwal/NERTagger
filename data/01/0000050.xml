        <p>LEAD: The new year is bringing a 1.3 percent benefit increase to the nation's 37 million Social Security beneficiaries and an end to the temporary respite from the payroll tax for 8.5 million Americans who paid the maximum levy in 1986.</p>
        <p>The new year is bringing a 1.3 percent benefit increase to the nation's 37 million Social Security beneficiaries and an end to the temporary respite from the payroll tax for 8.5 million Americans who paid the maximum levy in 1986.</p>
        <p>It took earnings of $42,000 or more in 1986 to earn a break from the Social Security tax.</p>
        <p>But in 1987, taxpayers will have to earn $43,800 before the payroll tax ends for the year.</p>
        <p>Although the tax rate remains unchanged at 7.15 percent, the increase in the wage ceiling to $43,800 means the maximum tax on employees will rise to $3,131.70. That is $128.70, or 4.3 percent, more than 1986's top tax. Employers pay the same amount.</p>
        <p>The average monthly benefit for retired workers will rise by $6, to $488. For an elderly couple, the average payment will go up by $11, to $833.</p>
        <p>But most of the elderly will find their ''take home'' pay from Social Security going up less than $6 because they will be charged $2.40 more each month for Medicare coverage.</p>
        <p>The benefit increase matches the change in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of 1985 through the third quarter of 1986. It is the smallest rise since Social Security was linked to the price index in 1975.</p>
