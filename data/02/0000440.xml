        <p>LEAD: A confusing letter arrived the other day in the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.</p>
        <p>A confusing letter arrived the other day in the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.</p>
        <p>It came from Jackie Presser, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and it congratulated the Senator on his ''well-deserved election victory.'' But Senator Moynihan was last re-elected in 1982 and thus will not be eligible again for such good wishes, if at all, until late in 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Presser, not generally known as a kidder, is currently under indictment for embezzlement of union funds and has been identified by Government officials in the past as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>A Moynihan aide said of the letter: ''If Presser can't get this straight, what does he tell the F.B.I.?''  WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING</p>
