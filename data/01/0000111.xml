        <p>Czechoslovak authorities ordered Tuesday that three members of a banned cultural group who were arrested in September be released, but they remained in custody pending an appeal of the order, an emigre source said.</p>
        <p>The source identified the three as Cestmir Hunat, Tomas Krivanek and Vlastimil Drda, members of the defunct Czech Musicians Union's Jazz Section, which opposes state censorship of the arts.</p>
        <p>Seven Jazz Section activists were arrested in September on suspicion of conducting illegal business, mainly publishing unauthorized works.</p>
        <p>Two of the group were released Sunday because of ill health. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said authorities did not revoke investigative custody for the remaining two.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1971, the Jazz Section's nationwide membership of about 7,000 advocates freedom in the arts and opposes controls exerted by the Communist authorities.</p>
