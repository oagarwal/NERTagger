        <p>Citicorp and the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. will effect an extensive tie-up, possibly in April, that will effectively give each bank a network of branch offices in the other's country, The Yomiuri Shimbun said.</p>
        <p>The daily paper quoted informed sources as saying the Finance Ministry has informally approved the plan. No confirmation was immediately available.</p>
        <p>Citicorp and Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the biggest banks in the United States and Japan respectively, will let each other's customers use automatic telling machines in their respective countries under the plan, the sources were quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>The two banks will serve as each other's agents for such business as consumer and home mortgage loans and Dai-Ichi Kangyo will support Citicorp's Mastercard credit cards in Japan, the sources were quoted as saying.</p>
