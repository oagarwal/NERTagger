        <p>LEAD: A man with a semiautomatic rifle fired through the doors of a lounge filled with New Year's Eve revelers, killing a woman and wounding five people, three critically, the police said today.</p>
        <p>A man with a semiautomatic rifle fired through the doors of a lounge filled with New Year's Eve revelers, killing a woman and wounding five people, three critically, the police said today.</p>
        <p>The police said the shootings at the Hub Lounge here might have led to more deaths if a quick-thinking manager had not shut the doors after he saw the gunman go to his pickup truck and get the rifle.</p>
        <p>Cody Williams, a 43-year-old resident of Homer, was arrested about a mile from the lounge and was being held without bond on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kim Addison, 26, the police said.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Mr. Williams had gone to the lounge earlier in the evening and quarreled with a woman described as a former companion who worked there. The woman, who was not identified by the police, was said to be uninjured.</p>
        <p>The police said the man was later stopped from entering by employees who reported that he was carrying a pistol. He left the bar, then came back minutes later with a .233-caliber rifle and shot through the front doors, Officer John Bacot said.</p>
