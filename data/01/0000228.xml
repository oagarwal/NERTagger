        <p>Genentech Inc., a leading biotechnology company based in South San Francisco, said its limited partners had approved the company's early buyout of two research partnerships. The partnerships had sponsored the development of three promising drugs - growth hormone, interferon and a blood clot dissolver. The buyback, which will cost Genentech more than $400 million, received a majority vote despite the opposition of two partners who argued that the original agreement, which would pay them a royalty on sales, was worth more.</p>
